For visual learners, there is this Youtube video (17 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyrUentbkvw&ab_channel=JordanBoyd-Graber

PyTorch implementation of the continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW) approach to fitting models here: https://rguigoures.github.io/word2vec_pytorch/

**Reminder:** The goal for Tuesday will be to just make sure we all understand what word2vec is meant to do and why it is interesting, as well as getting an initial sense of the steps involved in fitting such a model to some corpus of data. We will then spend a week playing around with getting it to work on something of interest.

Chapter 6 of Jurafsy and Martin's NLP textbook is a helpful detailed guide to some of the concepts related to Word2Vec and embeddings in general - https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf
