### Transformers

Transformers are state-of-the-art sequence models used broadly in machine translation, image-recognition, and many more sequence-based tasks. They provide a few nice advantages over classic neural network language models such as RNNs and LSTMs, though they have their own limitations.

Here are some resources to get you started
