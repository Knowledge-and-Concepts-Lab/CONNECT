# Variational auto-encoders
This directory contains files relevant to experimenting with / understanding variational auto-encoders.

The following resources for this discussion were compiled by Ivette Colon and Declan Campbell:

First, a comprehensive overview of VAEs, from dimensionality reduction basics to variational inference:

For those with less time, a shorter introduction to VAEs with a link to the authorâ€™s Github for implementation of a simple VAE:

And for those looking to get deep into the math behind it all (also with a link to Pytorch/Keras implementations):
