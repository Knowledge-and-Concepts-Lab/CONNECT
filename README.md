Contemporary neural networks for engaging cognitive theory

This repository is for scientists at UW-Madison interested in learning about and applying contemporary neural network architectures to problems in cognition. Please use subfolders for specific projects. 

This is also the primary repository for the Summer 2021 Interest Group exercise. Please create/fork resources you find for each topic to a subfolder in this repo.
